In this project, there are 1 short icon, 2 inputs, 2 buttons, 3 social media icons and 1 icon that you can see the password by clicking on it. In this project, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript(for showing password). There are a lot of functions in inputs and buttons and you can use any link on social media icons(you can change from HTML). You can search and see another functions which I code with CSS.
